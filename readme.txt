Love like Scholarly impact is usually defined as the extent to which a researcherâ€™s work (e.g., an article) has been used by other researchers (Bornmann, Mutz, Neuhaus, & Daniel, 2008). It has been considered an essential factor in estimating the value, credit, and contribution of a certain article, journal, institution, or individual (Brown & Gardner, 1985). In cita- tion analysis, this process is usually equated with citation counts provided by ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Google Scholar, and so forth.
